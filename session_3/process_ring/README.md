Session 3
=========

In which @sohjiro and @MachinesAreUs presented their
respective solutions to the "Process Ring" problem.

Afterwards, as an excercise, and based in @MachinesAreUs'
solution, each team attemped to make this process ring
a fault tolerant one, in the sense that if a process
in the ring was externally killed (either by asking 
politely to exit by sendig a message or by killing it 
via Process.exit), the ring should continue working.

We setup 4 teams.

* Felipomp (@sohjiro, @BusinessRul, @jl_rayon)
* JJs (@neodevelop, @luis_rayon)
* Tortugas (@gzfrancisco, @licuadolala) 
* Agus (@d5lment, @MachinesAreUs)

Only Felipomp and JJ's completed their solution, which 
afterwards was explained in detail to everyoe. 

We compared the different approaches taken by the different
teams and discussed the tradeoffs made in each one.

Finally we outlined a solution that took some of the ideas
from the different teams but is in principle more robust 
than any of the previous solutions.
