In the 1st session of our dojo, we had 14 participants!

We reviewed the following topics with examples:

- Pattern matching.
- Anonymous functions and functions within modules.
- Functions with multiple clauses and the importance of the order of declaration.
- Function guards.
- Capture syntax and partial function application. e.g. &sum.(&1, 5)
- Use of other modules (import, alias, require, use).
- Lists, tuples and keyword lists.
- Importance of the Enum module. e.g. Enum.map
- Conditionasl (if, cond, case)
- Basic usage of mix to create and compile projects and to execute test suites.
- Creation of simple tests with ExUnit and how to run our tests in parallel.
- Basic usage of iex:
  - autocompletion
  - consulting documentation
  - loading our project dependencies and modules.

After that we formed couples to implement the classic FizzBuzz with unit tests.
